# About

[CETech1](https://github.com/cyberegoorg/cetech1) is experimental game engine write in awesome language named [zig](https://ziglang.org).
Some core features like [AsseDB](assetdb.md), [CDB](cdb.md) and [ApiDB](apidb.md) is based on BitSquid/OurMachinery blog posts.

## Goals

- Small reusable blocks that you can combine for what your project need. This is opposite to engine like Unreal, Unity etc.
- Zero-work editor UI for new asset/data types. You can start with automatic-default and customize it later on your needed.
- Fast iteration on ideas by hot-reload assets and code.
- Multiplatform runtime + editor
- Hackable
